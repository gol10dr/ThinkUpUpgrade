This is a simple script I wrote to help me automate the upgrade of Thinkup.  Please make sure you run the database backup first prior to running the script. 

Assumptions:
============
- Script has been made executable (sudo chmod a+x)
- ThinkUp directory is in /var/www/thinkup/
- You have already backed up your thinkup database (you have been warned!)

Actions:
========
- Asks for the version number to upgrade to
- Asks for the version number you are currently running
- Backs up the current Thinkup directory
- Downloads the zip from GitHub
- Unzips the package over the current Thinkup directory
